# ASCII RPG Senior Project
 The main code for my Senior Project. Was built on a Linux server and runs in the terminal using ncurses to display graphics.
 Requires ncurses to run. This was a group project with 3 others in my Senior year.
 
 My main contributions were the player movement, the terrain generation and display, the camera following the player, 
 the terrain collision, as well as teleportation/transportation between map areas.

This is just a copy of the project. If you want to see the actual project repository in order to see my git commits for it,
the link for that is https://github.com/bjones40/ASCII-RPG .


All required source code for this to run should be available here. This project contains a Makefile as well.
